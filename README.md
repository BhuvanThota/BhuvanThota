# Hey, I’m Bhuvan 👋  

I’m a **backend-focused software engineer** who genuinely enjoys **building web apps that real people actually use** — sometimes for productivity, sometimes just for fun 😄  

Most of my time goes into:
- designing **clean, predictable APIs**
- working with **databases that won’t break at scale**
- deploying services to the cloud and **observing how systems behave in production**

I like understanding **what happens after deployment**, not just how things look in code.

When I’m not coding:
- 📚 I binge **story books & Audible** for hours every week  
- 🦸 I love reading **comics**  
- 🍎 My favorite snacks are 🍿 Popcorn, Apple, Pie — and yes, I love it even more when they’re combined (**Apple Pie** = ❤️ 🤤😄) .

## 🧠 What I love building

I enjoy building **systems that feel boring in the best way** — stable, predictable, and easy to maintain.

Things I enjoy working on:
- Backend services using **Java & Spring Boot**
- Clean, well-structured **REST APIs**
- Database-backed systems using **PostgreSQL**
- Dockerized applications deployed on **AWS**
- Full-stack projects when it helps ship a complete product 🚀

I care deeply about:
- Code readability & maintainability  
- APIs that are easy to consume  
- Stable deployments  
- Debugging *real* production issues (logs > assumptions)

## 🧩 Tech I work with

**Backend**  
Java · Spring Boot · REST APIs · Spring Data JPA  

**Database**  
PostgreSQL  

**Cloud & DevOps**
